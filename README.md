### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Courtois Neuromod](https://www.cneuromod.ca/) project with Prof. Leila Wehbe and Prof. Pierre Bellec in implementing encoding models to predict brain activities of processing the natural language using representations extracted from natural language models. My main interest lies in developing approaches to improve the predictive performance of the neural networks of language models with well-defined features from the cross-model brain representations of naturalistic information processing. I am originally a Pure Mathematician and hold a Ph.D. in Cybernetics, with thesis work on investigating the emergence of the knowledge of the novel concepts in the human brain using simultaneous EEG and fMRI.

I am a passionate advocate of the development and adoption of the open science/ source tool, practice, and methodologies by the widest possible communities to make the information and knowledge fair, transparent, accessible, and inclusive for all! 

I am also interested in AI Ethics and devoted to implementing and integrating responsible AI methodologies and technologies that serve not just for the sake of utility but above all, for humanity! Currently, I am actively take part in the various open science communities and unions to work towards making these aims to come true!
